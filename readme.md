Week5 day2 Data Modeling Lab

In this lab, I engaged in conceptual planning by brainstorming ideas for a recipe app's data model and determining tables needed for storing relevant information. I identified relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many connections between tables, and incorporated any additional tables required. Using DB Designer, I created a schema, defined table columns with appropriate data types, and exported a PDF of the schema. In my VSCode files, I detailed each table's columns, explaining the purpose of storing specific data and the chosen data types. Finally, in the Postgres terminal, I established a new database, drafted CREATE TABLE statements for each table, and explored data insertion using INSERT INTO statements, documenting my progress in the provided document.
